# QUBIT (TIMECHAIN) PROTOCOL 🏛️
**The 84,000,000 Sovereign Scarcity Engine**

QUBIT is a fully decentralized, non-governance timechain built on the principles of absolute scarcity and zero-knowledge privacy. 

## 📜 The Immutable Constitution
- **Fixed Supply:** 84,000,000 QBT (Hard Cap).
- **Consensus:** Sequential VDF (Proof-of-Time) + AI-Neural Shield.
- **Halving Cycle:** Every 840,000 blocks.
- **Privacy:** Mandatory ZK-SNARKs for transaction anonymity.

## 🤖 AI-Neural Protection
Every node runs a local Neural Guardian that analyzes network propagation. It detects and prevents:
1. **Selfish Mining:** Predictive analysis of block timing.
2. **Sybil Attacks:** Trust-scoring for P2P neighbors.
3. **Eclipse Defense:** Automatic isolation of anomalous peers.

## 🚀 Join the Network
To run your own sovereign node:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Rust.
3. `cargo run --release`

*The timeline is decentralized. No owners. No governance. Only math.*
