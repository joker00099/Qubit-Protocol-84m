# Axiom Proof-of-Useful-Work Mining

A revolutionary mining system that replaces wasteful hash puzzles with useful computational work.

## Overview

Instead of performing meaningless hash computations, Axiom miners contribute to solving real-world problems:

- **Protein Folding** - Molecular dynamics simulations for drug discovery
- **Optimization Problems** - Traveling Salesman and combinatorial optimization
- **Matrix Computations** - Large-scale linear algebra for scientific computing
- **Prime Number Search** - Mathematical research and cryptography
- **Machine Learning** - Neural network training for AI research

## Key Features

- **Useful Computation**: All mining work contributes to scientific progress
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficient multi-threaded work distribution
- **Verifiable Results**: Cryptographic proof of computation
- **Fair Rewards**: Base reward + bonus for completed work
- **Flexible Difficulty**: Scales from hobby miners to data centers
- **Energy Efficient**: Meaningful computation, not wasteful hashing

## Mining Process

### 1. Work Task Creation

The network generates useful work tasks based on:
- Current network difficulty
- Type of computation needed
- Available miner resources
- Scientific priorities

### 2. Task Distribution

Miners select tasks from the pool:
```rust
let task = pool.create_task(WorkType::ProteinFolding, difficulty: 5);
```

### 3. Computation

Miners perform the useful work:
```rust
let solution = parallel_mine(&task, miner_address, num_threads);
```

### 4. Verification

Solutions are verified and rewards distributed:
```rust
if pool.submit_solution(solution) {
    let reward = pool.calculate_reward(block_height, miner_address);
}
```
