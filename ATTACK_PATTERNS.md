# AXIOM Protocol - Attack Patterns & Detection (Draft)

## Patterns Considered
- Double spend
- Sybil attack
- Eclipse attack
- DDoS
- Long-range attack
- Selfish mining
- Byzantine peer behavior

## Current Detection
- Heuristic-based anomaly detection (not AI/ML)
- Peer message rate monitoring
- Block timing analysis
- Transaction pattern flagging

## Planned Improvements
- Documented ML/AI methodology (if implemented)
- Accuracy and false positive/negative metrics
- Comparison with rule-based systems

This document will be updated as detection mechanisms evolve.
