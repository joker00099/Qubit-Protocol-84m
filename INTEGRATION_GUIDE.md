# AXIOM Protocol Integration Guide (Draft)

## Overview
This guide explains how to integrate external applications or services with AXIOM Protocol. The project is experimental and APIs may change.

## RPC/API
- No formal RPC or API specification yet
- Planned: Basic JSON-RPC for block, transaction, and state queries

## Example Usage
- See axiom-app-demo.py for basic Python integration
- Use Rust modules for direct integration

## Planned Features
- Documented API endpoints
- Example client libraries (Python, Rust)
- Integration tests

---
This guide will be expanded as APIs are developed.
